This Dino Game automation is made by Daniel Szabo.
a few guidlines to note:

1. To open the game you need a Google Chrome browser, then type chrome://dino

2. It should take an ammount of tinkering to figure out the optimal place to connect the photocell to the screen.
to do that you should first figure out which is the optimal place to jump (press space) and then connect the photocell to the screen in this position.
i used a transperant tape.
 
3. To find the grey threshold i moved the picture across the Sensor to see which color is grey and which is white, (mine was around 75 for white and 35 for grey)
you can use the Serial Monitor to find your screens white and grey value and change the thresholds accordingly.

4. You need to position the servo above the space. then you should change the angles acorrding to the position of your keyboard.

5. In currect version the ducking is done manualy using down arrow. in future vesion i will utilize a second servo to the down arrow key.

Enjoy!!
